# This skill sets agent-dyno up before it reports agent-dyno is up

You are about to bring **agent-dyno** up from a *recipe*, not from a finished instance. The
skill ships agent-dyno as source: a carried recipe plus the pin to the code that runs it, like
a self-extracting archive that carries both its contents and the unpacker. Before you tell
anyone agent-dyno is running, deploy it against **this** target and GRADE it honestly. You do
the work in-loop; nobody runs a command line. The material is the carried recipe, the
binds, the checks, and the acceptance in the sections below.

Two roles run through this. The **author** packaged agent-dyno as this skill on their machine.
The **receiver** is whoever installs it, a different target, whose substrate, secrets, and
paths you resolve here. You work so the receiver reaches a real, graded agent-dyno, or an honest
reason it could not, never a silent success.

## Recipe (run before your first report that agent-dyno is up)

1. **Cache / idempotency.** If agent-dyno is already up on this target in this session (a prior
   graded namespace exists, or a resolution is recorded here), reuse it, emit the Reusing
   line, and skip to step 6. Do not re-deploy over a live instance.

2. **Resolve the binds.** For each entry in the binds section, probe this target for the
   matching capability, and resolve the isolation substrate to the required strength the
   carried recipe names. If a *required* bind has no match here, or no substrate meets the
   required strength, STOP, deploy nothing, and report cannot-build naming the missing one.
   Never guess and never substitute. If you cannot positively confirm a required bind,
   treat it as missing.

3. **Self-extract the runtime (the bootstrap).** The carried recipe carries a pin under
   `operators` (`version`, `url`, `sha256`), but the code that runs the deploy lives
   *inside* that kit, so you unpack it yourself first, and only after verifying it. Do
   exactly this: (a) fetch the tarball at the pin `url`; (b) compute its sha256 and confirm
   it equals the pin's `sha256`, if it does not, STOP and report cannot-build (tampered or
   wrong kit), and never unpack or run an unverified tarball; (c) extract the verified
   tarball, that unpack IS the self-extraction, and it yields the runtime: `hoist/pins.py`
   (fetch and verify), `envelope/` (the enforced grader: isolation, honest grade,
   teardown), and the operator steps. From here the extracted runtime drives the graded
   pass and re-verifies the kit into its cache. Because you checked the sha256 by hand
   before unpacking, nothing unverified executes.

4. **Know early, then deploy.** Run the pre-check first, it deploys nothing. If it says
   cannot-build, stop at the door and give the user the named reason. Otherwise run the
   full graded pass through the extracted grader, which *enforces* the invariants: a
   runner-owned isolated namespace (non-destructive), and teardown. You never re-run
   agent-dyno's own singular deployment onto a live host.

5. **Grade.** The acceptance checks rebuild on THIS target. Compute the honest transfer
   score, how many of the acceptance checks passed, N of M, and name every check that did
   not transfer.

6. **Report** the outcome in one line, using one of the templates below. Never let a design
   read as a running system; if it did not transfer, say what did not.

7. **Hand off.** Point the user at any follow-up the carried recipe includes (how to
   extend it, operate it, or keep it running), so they can use agent-dyno, not merely have it
   installed.

Before your first report, state in one line what happened, only one line, and do not
narrate the loop, using one of these templates:
- "Built agent-dyno. Acceptance transferred N of M on this target. Ready."
- "Built agent-dyno, but N of M acceptance checks did not transfer here: [the specific checks]."
- "Cannot build agent-dyno: this target is missing [the named bind or substrate strength]."
- "Reusing the agent-dyno setup from earlier this session. Ready."

The failure to avoid: reporting agent-dyno is up because the recipe *looks* right. It is up only
when it deployed and its acceptance transferred on this target. Grade it, then report what
you measured.

## Binds (resolve these on the target; a missing required one is cannot-build)

- `git` (required), probe: `git --version`
- `python3` (required), probe: `python3 --version`
- isolation substrate: none required, this profile is hermetic (hermetic: everything runs inside a throwaway clone. demo.py fabricates its own synthetic snapshot and a throwaway git repo under .hoist-report/_demo and renders the report there; it starts no daemons, binds no host ports, and writes no state outside the clone. Nothing leaves the machine.).

## Checks (invariants every deploy obeys)

- **Non-destructive.** The deploy lands in a runner-owned isolated namespace (its own name, ports, storage); a profile that declares no isolation is refused; teardown always runs. It never re-runs agent-dyno's own singular deployment onto a live host.
- **No silent success.** agent-dyno is graded on the real target; a run that cannot say it worked says what did not transfer. A design never reads as a running system.
- **Verified runtime.** The fetched kit is run only after its sha256 matches the carried pin; a tampered or unreachable kit is cannot-build, named.

## Acceptance (the held-back transfer test; the honest score)

- `numerator-selftest`: `python3 core/test_survival_git.py`
- `driver-selftest`: `python3 skills/dyno-report/test_dyno_report.py`
- `evidence-selftest`: `python3 adapters/claude-code/fingerprint_evidence.py --selftest`
